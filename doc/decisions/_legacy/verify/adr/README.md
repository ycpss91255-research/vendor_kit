# ADR index + PRD audit

This is the index of base's Architecture Decision Records **and** the
audit that maps each ADR onto [`doc/PRD.md`](../PRD.md) -- base's north
star. Every ADR now carries a one-line `> Serves:` back-reference to the
PRD invariant (1-11), goal, or scope item it upholds; this table is the
consolidated view.

**The filesystem is the ADR registry.** There is no database and no
manually-curated master list of numbers -- the set of `doc/adr/NNNNNNNN-<slug>.md`
files *is* the registry. The ADR-numbering lint
(`script/test/drivers/adr_numbering.sh`, wired into `just test`; landed
with the PRD work under #808 / #823) guards it: a duplicate ADR number or
a malformed filename **fails** CI, while a numbering **gap** is warned,
not failed. This `README.md` is deliberately *not* an ADR file (its name
does not match `NNNNNNNN-<slug>.md`), so it does not perturb that lint.

**Authoring rule.** The ADR-structure lint
(`script/test/drivers/adr_structure.sh`) requires exactly one occurrence of
each required part -- `> Serves:`, `## Context`, `## Decision`,
`## Consequences`, `## Alternatives`, `- **Status:**` -- at column 0, so an
ADR that illustrates one of those lines indents the illustration out of
column 0, and an amendment that restates a section or a status uses a `###`
heading or a different key (`- **Amendment status:**`). The rule is about
column 0 and nothing else -- the lint does not know what a fence is -- so a
parked or commented-out copy of one of those lines counts exactly like a
live one and is indented too.

## Anomalies (resolved)

- **`00000009` is an intentional gap.** There is no ADR-9 and none will
  be back-filled; the number was skipped. The numbering lint warns on it
  and passes. Do not invent a `00000009`.
- **`ADR-00000020` is a single canonical record.** A parallel-authoring
  incident once produced two files both numbered `ADR-00000020` (the very
  case the #823 numbering lint now catches). The canonical
  `00000020-base-owns-single-service-lifecycle.md` is the foundational
  "base owns the single-service lifecycle" axiom; the separate
  init-default-toggle content was **folded into** it (init defaults ON is
  ADR-20's two-branch-rule example, see its Consequences). There is no
  second ADR-20.

## Verdict vocabulary

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `keep` | Accurate as written; no change needed (inline amendments, where present, are already recorded in the file). |
| `amend` | A factual detail is now stale and should be refreshed (tracked as a follow-up, not edited here). |
| `supersede` | Replaced by a later ADR (named). |
| `merge` | Overlaps another ADR and could be consolidated (named). |
| `elevates-invariant` | Established a PRD Core Invariant (named 1-11). |
| `elevates-principle` | Established a PRD Design Principle (named P1-P9). |

The eleven PRD Core Invariants: **1** one container = one service / base
owns the single-service lifecycle; **2** never fail silently; **3**
composable by construction; **4** fail-safe defaults; **5** the
two-branch default rule; **6** base is a subtree / downstream a thin
caller; **7** rigorous, industry-aligned test bar; **8** development and
field are cleanly separated, provisioned by opposite means; **9** identity
and naming are resolved once, from a file; **10** documentation is
derived from the code, never duplicated beside it; **11** a default is
decided by two questions, not by preference. ADRs that are pure
*mechanisms* serve a goal but map to no invariant -- the table says so
explicitly. Below the invariants the PRD also carries **Design
Principles** (P1-P9) and a **Conflict Priority** order; an ADR that
establishes one of those is `elevates-principle`.

## Audit table

| ADR | Verdict | Serves | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00000001 -- setup.conf vs compose-native boundary | keep | mechanism (config-resolution boundary; serves the one-source-render goal), no invariant | The escape-hatch/`--env-file` case was refined into a primary path by ADR-00000003. |
| 00000002 -- no `latest` tag for base | keep | invariant 6 (subtree / propagation) -- mechanism | Immutable version pinning of subtree + workflow refs keeps propagation reproducible. Dated example `v0.39.0` is self-dating. |
| 00000003 -- env vs workload boundary + field delivery | keep (amended by 00000023) | invariant 3 (axis-A `.env` overlay model) + goal (one source -> many render; field delivery); also invariant 8 (its env-row override generalizes to config files) | Foundational to the PRD Product Shape; refines ADR-00000001; the overlay model is the seed ADR-00000022 later elevates. **Amended 2026-07-15 (ADR-00000023):** its structured-config Field cell gains a mount-wins `-v` override and "compose does not travel" is refined to "a resolved compose travels" (in-file amendment note). |
| 00000004 -- category-first test layout | supersede (by 00000012) | invariant 7 (test bar) -- mechanism | Category-first reversed to tool-first; Status already records the supersession. |
| 00000005 -- adopt `just` over the Makefile | keep | invariant 6 (thin-caller entrypoint) -- mechanism | The single discoverable user entry ADR-00000010/00000011 build on. Dated `13 downstream repos` / `v0.39.0` are self-dating. |
| 00000006 -- upgrade.sh path contract | keep | invariant 6 (subtree upgrade path) -- mechanism | Frozen interior paths; already carries forward-pointers to ADR-00000010/00000011's `dist/` moves. |
| 00000007 -- log TTY cache + transcript layering | keep | mechanism (wrapper log/transcript single-sink fidelity), no invariant | Ensures a transcript tee cannot silently flip terminal output format. |
| 00000008 -- sharded coverage PR gate | keep | invariant 7 (coverage gate -- a *swappable* mechanism, not the invariant) | Heavily amended inline (Codecov removed, dynamic shards, per-line union merge); all recorded in-file. |
| 00000010 -- layered `just` entry + base/downstream split | elevates-invariant (6) | invariant 6 (subtree / thin caller) | Established the `dist/` split + layered entry. Its docker-top-level decision was superseded-in-part by ADR-00000011 sec.1 -- recommend a forward-pointer (follow-up). |
| 00000011 -- zero-special-case `just` command model | elevates-invariant (6) | invariant 6 (subtree / thin caller) | The current command model + generic test runner; amends ADR-00000010 and ADR-00000006. |
| 00000012 -- tool-first test layout | keep (supersedes 00000004) | invariant 7 (test bar) -- mechanism | Its category *vocabulary* was later amended by ADR-00000018; forward-pointer already present. |
| 00000013 -- strip transient issue refs from comments | keep | invariant 2 (never fail silently) -- the issue-ref lint | PRD invariant 2 names the issue-ref lint as one of its enforcing guards. |
| 00000014 -- decompose setup.sh into subsystem libs | keep | mechanism (source architecture / testability), no invariant | Deep-module decomposition; underpins invariant 7's testability but is an architecture decision. |
| 00000015 -- test files mirror source | keep | invariant 7 (test bar) -- mechanism | Lowers the per-file coverage shard floor; complements ADR-00000008/00000012. |
| 00000016 -- coverage tooling evaluation | keep | invariant 7 (swappable coverage mechanism) | Status is **Rejected**: the spike disproved the "kcov = heavy ptrace" premise; kcov stays. Accurate record. |
| 00000017 -- CI throughput ceiling + shard strategy | keep | invariant 7 (swappable CI/shard mechanism) | PRD explicitly lists this as a swappable mechanism under invariant 7. |
| 00000018 -- ISTQB test taxonomy | elevates-invariant (7) | invariant 7 (rigorous, industry-aligned test bar) | The *commitment* establisher; supersedes only ADR-00000012's category vocabulary. |
| 00000019 -- network host default, bridge opt-in | elevates-invariant (4) | invariant 4 (fail-safe defaults) | The general principle's instance; a sibling lifecycle-defaults decision to ADR-00000020. |
| 00000020 -- base owns the single-service lifecycle | elevates-invariant (1) | invariant 1 (single-service lifecycle); also invariant 5 (two-branch default rule) | Canonical single ADR-20; init-toggle content folded in (see Anomalies). |
| 00000021 -- per-start container logs + shared logrotate | keep | invariant 1 (single-service lifecycle) -- mechanism | The #805 log-persistence lifecycle capability realising invariant 1. |
| 00000022 -- compose<->multi_run overlay contract | keep (amended by 00000025) | invariant 3 (composable by construction); also invariant 2 (the overlay guard) | The overlay contract + `overlay_guard_spec.bats`; PRD names it under both invariants 2 and 3. **Amended 2026-08-05 (ADR-00000025):** the project `name:` row's emitted form is now `${PROJECT_NAME}` (still an interpolation, so the forward invariant and its guard are untouched), plus an explicit statement that a per-worktree `.setup.conf.local` is NOT this contract's mechanism -- it acts before `compose.yaml` is generated (in-file amendment note). |
| 00000023 -- config field-override + self-contained field-deploy contract | elevates-invariant (8) | invariant 8 (dev/field separation, provisioned by opposite means) -- established with ADR-00000003 | The git-tracked provisioning axis, baked-default + mount-wins `-v` override (file analog of ADR-3's env `-e`), deploy-as-resolved-self-contained-compose (amends ADR-3's "compose does not travel"), the deployable-stage rule, and the `config/<component>/deploy.manifest` tunability channel. Reconciled with ADR-00000022 (single-file config `-v` != general volume topology). Mechanism in #831 / #832 / #833. **Amended twice in-file (#874):** sec. 2 now states the mount-override is read-only by default with an explicit `rw` opt-in (#870), and sec. 4's `deployable = not devel and not *-test` is restated as what `_is_deployable_stage` actually enforces (it also rejects `sys` / `devel-base` and the legacy aliases). |
| 00000024 -- bake self-built artifacts at `/opt`, not `$HOME` | keep | invariant 8 (dev/field separation) -- mechanism; also invariant 2 via the `home-literal` lint | `ENV HOME` resolves at BUILD time, so anything baked under `$HOME` is coupled to the build-time `USER_NAME` and breaks on a rebuild / GHCR pull / `docker save`+`load` under a different user. Artifacts go to absolute `/opt`; `~/x -> /opt/x` is a discoverability symlink nothing sources. Its mechanical rule (no concrete username in a path) is gated by the `home-literal` lint. |
| 00000025 -- per-worktree `.setup.conf.local` override + one resolved project name | elevates-invariant (9) | invariant 9 (runtime-name divergence is a file-recorded override) -- established; also invariant 2 (shadowed-write warning, deploy refusal, config-summary row) and invariant 8 (the field refusal) | Third conf layer (`.setup.conf.local`, gitignored, section-replace like the two below it), `[project] name` shipped empty, and `_resolve_project_name` as the single producer both `-p` and compose's `name:` read via `.env.generated`. Un-retires the `.gitignore` entry #879 retired. Removes `SETUP_CONF`. Explicitly NOT a reversal of #600 (configuration, not orchestration) and NOT ADR-00000022's channel (acts before compose.yaml is generated) -- **amends ADR-00000022 in-file** with that division of labour and the `${PROJECT_NAME}` row. |
| 00000026 -- self-hosted eligibility is a static property of `runs-on` | keep | invariant 7 (rigorous test bar) -- mechanism; also invariant 2 (the `self-hosted-guard` lint, and the fork-PR rollup failure instead of a vacuous green) | The org runs ONE org-level self-hosted runner in a `visibility: all` / `allows_public_repositories: true` group, on a shared workstation, and this repo is public. Eligibility is computed from `runs-on` (anything that does not statically resolve to a reserved `ubuntu-*` / `windows-*` / `macos-*` label is eligible and fails closed), so the guard cannot be missed by job N+1 the way `_LINT_TOOLS` / the downstream roster / the release archive path list each were. Enforced by the `self-hosted-guard` lint; `ci-rollup` fails a fork PR rather than collapsing a guarded skip into a green required check. Prerequisite named by ADR-00000017. |
| 00000027 -- release cadence + fanout trigger (Z automatic/per-bug, X/Y human, only X/Y fans out) | keep | invariant 6 (subtree / propagation) -- the cadence at which the single source of truth propagates, and who decides each step; also invariant 2 (the classification reasoning is recorded, so a wrong call is reviewable rather than invisible) | Policy behind the `semver-bump` / `/release` procedure, not a new mechanism. A `vX.Y.Z` (Z>0) is cut by the agent without asking -- restoring `semver-bump`'s own table -- and **one bug = one Z**, so a downstream can name the release carrying its fix; `vX.Y.0` / `vX.0.0` stay the maintainer's. The binding half is classification: an issue whose fix changes behaviour is a Y no matter what it is labelled (the v0.42.1 content -- #914, #915, PR #929, #882 -- is the recorded case). #927's fanout is triggered by X/Y **only**: `just base upgrade <tag>` is one `git subtree pull` to that tag, so a Y delivers every Z in between and nothing is skipped -- only the notification is batched. PR-body requirements depend on #926. **Amended 2026-09-03 (ADR-00000031):** sections 1 and 3 gain a third actor -- a Z may also be cut by a GATE, with no person and no agent in the loop, in the one case a gate can decide (a downstream repo's ABI-safe dependency bump); section 2 is untouched and bounds it, and section 4 keeps such a Z from fanning out (in-file amendment section). |
| 00000028 -- documentation is derived, not duplicated (test statistics live only in the release) | elevates-invariant (10) | invariant 10 (documentation is derived, not duplicated) -- established; also invariant 2 (a hand-maintained figure goes stale silently) | A figure a machine can compute is computed when it is needed, not stored where a person keeps it true; the statistics belong to a release, rendered from the JUnit XML the tag-push run emits. Records the distinction from PR #943 (which deleted a hand-built *source* archive GitHub already produces, not run evidence) and names #952's committed coverage SVG as the open case the invariant decides. **Amended twice, both in sec. 1.** #999 (2026-09-03): the per-test rows are KEPT and GENERATED from `# why:` markers beside each test -- deleting was cheaper than relocating only while relocating meant doing it by hand. #978 (2026-09-04): the five grand-total lines are GONE and `_sync_test_md_index` with them, but the per-spec `### <path> (N)` count, the per-level catalogue totals and the doc-count drift gate all STAY, so invariant 2's guard list is unchanged. Sec. 2's release report is still unbuilt. |
| 00000029 -- early return is the default function shape | elevates-principle | PRD design principle P1 (early return is the default shape of every function) -- established; no invariant directly (it is the function-level shape ADR-00000014's seams assume, so it stands behind invariant 7's testability) | Decision 1 of the #994 quality epic. States the shape rather than the limit: the depth/length/parameter thresholds are a net that reports where the shape was not applied, not a target. Records the rejection of a baseline file (a hand-kept roster that decays and converts a gate into an inventory of debt) and of gating new code only, and the framing error it corrects -- an earlier nesting audit read depth as 44 violations to rank and fix, which buys 44 fixes and then 44 more because it never reaches the next function written. |
| 00000035 -- `compose.yaml` lives at the repo root, and a test has a level AND a type | keep | invariant 2 (never fail silently) -- both halves are questions whose wrong answer is SILENT: a compose file Compose cannot find changes the project name rather than erroring, and a taxonomy read as one axis makes a live test category look retired | Answers two questions asked on 2026-09-05 that had no record to point at. The compose half: the file is not CI-only (`test.sh` names it on the local `just test` path and no workflow names it at all), and it stays at the root because Compose derives the project name from the config file's DIRECTORY, because discovery traverses parents from the root, and because `.github/` is GitHub's namespace. The counter-case is recorded rather than dismissed. The taxonomy half re-states ADR-00000018's two axes because the model is routinely read as one list, which makes `smoke` look retired: it is a TYPE, its own directory reflects WHEN it runs (COPYed into every `-test` stage, executed during `docker build`) not how much it covers, and 17 files plus two changes on 2026-09-05 say it is live. `behavioural` was checked for rot: 88 mentions, every live one the adjective, not the retired category. |
| 00000036 -- base is a building block: both generate stages are parameterised APIs | elevates-invariant (3) | invariant 3 (composable by construction) -- restated. The overlay ADR-00000022 built to serve invariant 3 serves it only for VALUES; an assembler composing several instances of one repo needs SHAPES too, and could not get them | Four issues filed from the consuming side (#1051 colliding fields with no channel, #1056 the undiscoverable 15-section boundary, #1062 emitter decisions with no key, #1064 two bundles from one repo colliding) turned out to be one wall: `${VAR}` substitutes into lines that already exist, so build args, image rules and conditional blocks were permanently per-repo. The rule replacing the per-section table: anything decided at build time or before the container starts must be caller-reachable; only what is internal to a running container is outside. Two mechanisms -- a caller-supplied path for the `.setup.conf.local` layer, and an output directory for devel generation. ADR-00000022 s1 (no per-instance regenerate) and s3 (GPU/runtime/hostname correctly shared) and ADR-00000025 s6 (the worktree-vs-instance line) are amended in place, not superseded: the overlay stays correct for value-shaped fields, and s1's reasoning was sound while generation could only write into the repo. Accepted cost: a wider support surface, and multi_run#26 changes shape (it calls base to generate per instance instead of driving one pre-generated file with `-p`). |
| 00000032 -- the container entry point is base's; the repo's entrypoint is a bringup it sources | elevates-invariant (6) | invariant 6 (base is a subtree, downstream a thin caller) -- the mechanism half: anything base must be able to change later has to ship from `.base/`, so it cannot live in a file seeded into a repo and owned by it from then on | base's plumbing moved out of the seeded `script/entrypoint.sh` into an orchestrator shipped in the runtime helper directory. Records why base does NOT rewrite existing entrypoints (only the owner can tell a bringup line from base plumbing), and why the two per-repo edits -- flip `ENTRYPOINT`, clean the bringup -- must land together. Adds `/usr/local/lib/base/entrypoint.sh`; changes no path ADR-00000006 freezes. |
| 00000031 -- ABI-gated dependency-bump auto-release | keep (amends 00000027) | invariant 6 (one convention in base rather than seventeen repo-local definitions of "safe to release") -- mechanism; also invariant 4 ("cannot determine" resolves to not releasing) and invariant 2 (the gate names the rule that refused) | The answer to #829's second half. `script/ci/abi-gate.sh` decides one question -- did this dependency's declared ABI component move -- and refuses everything else: an unreadable version, an undeclared or unrecognised axis, a 0.x pin declared major-only, a downgrade, an unchanged pin, a pair the upstream compat declaration does not sanction. No default ABI axis, deliberately: librealsense's SONAME carries its minor and a plain major-only library disagrees, so any default is wrong for somebody in the direction that releases a break. A gate may cut a Z and nothing else, which is what keeps it inside ADR-00000027 section 2. The release goes through the new `version` input of `release-worker.yaml` (`on: workflow_call` only, reached by a caller's job) rather than a bot-pushed tag, because an event created with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts no workflow run. Written against #1012's defect class. |
| 00000030 -- the `config/<component>/` layout + the preset selector | keep | invariant 8 (dev/field separation) -- completes ADR-00000023 with the half it left open, WHICH config a build bakes; also invariant 4 (the committed preset is the inert one), invariant 2 (a selector resolving to nothing is reported, not found inside `docker build`) and invariant 10 (audience is not a second record of tunability) | Answers #826 ask 1 and all five of #827, which ADR-00000023 only forward-referenced. The org was surveyed first: preset selection had already converged on one shape in three repos (a repo-root symlink into `config/<component>/` read through an `ARG` whose default is its own name), so the decision writes down what works rather than inventing a mechanism -- and the one repo choosing a preset without the symlink pays for it with a three-branch `COPY` fallback duplicated per stage. Grouping is by count, not taxonomy (`launch/` exists once there is a second `*.launch`), which describes 6 of 6 component directories today where mandatory type-first would migrate 4. Audience directories are refused as a second record of what `deploy.manifest` already says. Enforcement reaches only what base can see: base reports the selectors in the tree it runs against, and nothing gates a downstream's directory shape. |

## Audit conclusion

- **keep:** 18 (00000001, 00000002, 00000003, 00000005, 00000006,
  00000007, 00000008, 00000012, 00000013, 00000014, 00000015, 00000016,
  00000017, 00000021, 00000024, 00000026, 00000027, 00000031) -- 00000003
  is `keep (amended by 00000023)` and 00000031 is `keep (amends 00000027)`,
  both amendments recorded inline in-file. 00000024, 00000026, 00000027 and
  00000031 postdate the audit itself and are listed for index
  completeness.
- **supersede:** 1 (00000004, by 00000012 -- already recorded)
- **elevates-invariant:** 9 (00000010, 00000011 -> inv 6; 00000018 -> inv
  7; 00000019 -> inv 4; 00000020 -> inv 1; 00000022 -> inv 3; 00000023 ->
  inv 8; 00000025 -> inv 9; 00000028 -> inv 10). Invariant 11 was not
  established by an ADR: it is invariant 5 generalised in the PRD itself,
  and ADR-00000020 / ADR-00000019 / ADR-00000007 are the instances it
  reads back.
- **elevates-principle:** 1 (00000029 -> P1). Postdates the audit; listed
  for index completeness.
- 00000030 -> invariant 6. Postdates the audit; listed for index
  completeness.
- **00000030** postdates the audit and is listed for index completeness;
  its verdict column reads `keep` because it is a mechanism decision under
  invariant 8, which ADR-00000023 already established.
- **amend:** 0 in the verdict column; 1 recommended follow-up (a
  forward-pointer on 00000010 -- see below)
- **merge:** 0

The decision log is already internally coherent: every ADR that was
reversed or refined by a later one carries its own inline
amendment/supersession note. The audit's net additions are the per-ADR
`> Serves:` invariant back-references and this index. The only structural
gap found is that ADR-00000010's now-reversed "docker top-level" decision
has no forward-pointer to ADR-00000011; it is listed as a follow-up for a
maintainer to close, not edited here (per the "no technical-content edits
in this slice" rule).
